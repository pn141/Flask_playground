# Flask-playground
A Flask boilerplate that lets you register your users and login to your site.

# Description
Flask-playground came to life while trying to learn Flask using Miguel Grinberg's "Flask Web Development". I would recommend this book to anyone on the same learning path. I have tried different online Flask resources; Miguel's book is by far the best.

Flask-playground follows Miguel's book up to (and including) chapter 8: "User authentication". I stopped there because the important scaffholding for a large Flask application structure is already in place; the application at this point is still generic enough to become anything and has not turned yet into the social blogging application Miguel uses as an illustration for his book. 

So while I will document what I have learned (as a work in progress), the best and most comprehensive reference to understand application structure, templates, web forms, database overview, email or user authentication is "Flask Web Development" by Miguel Grinberg.

In the meantime and on your journey to better Flask programming, feel free to experiment with Flask-playground.
